          Tashkent State Transport University was established in 1931 under the
          name of the Central Asian Institute of Railway Transport Engineers
          (SAZIIT), and it began its activity by training specialists –
          mechanics and operators.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1930, in Tashkent, under the management of the Tashkent Railway,
          courses were organized for the training and retraining of engineers
          and technical personnel with narrow specializations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In August 1931, the first student enrollment was announced, resulting
          in the admission of 125 people as the first students from among
          railway workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The teaching staff of SAZIIT was initially formed from course
          employees, specialists from the Krasnovostochniy Railway Node, and
          part-time teachers from the Central Asian State University. The
          Academic Council included teachers, employees of the Central Asian
          Railway Administration, plant workers, and other public organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 1931/1932 academic year, 35 permanent teachers worked at
          SAZIIT. Among them were the institute's first organizers, including
          M.Ya.Botolov, Yu.Goltsman, V.Dimushin, M.Egorov, A.Zinovieva, A.Kraft,
          S.Novokreshchenov, Nurmuhamedov, M.Strusevich, T.Kuchkarov,
          V.Kapustin, Kh.Khojaev, D.Zaglyadimov, A.Tsenin, N.Pisarev, A.Suvorov,
          E.Yakub, and others. The base for classes was the factory, railway
          departments of the Tashkent Junction, and the Central Asian State
          University. Student dormitories were located in various districts of
          Tashkent.
        </p>
        <p>
          In November 1931, the Railway Department of SAZIIT was established,
          and at the same time, at a meeting of the institute's Academic
          Council, it was decided to establish branches of the institute in
          Ashgabat, Krasnovodsk, Almaty, and Orenburg, as well as to organize
          vocational schools and their branches.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1931, the organizational structure of the institute was defined,
          which included: the directorate; 4 departments — "Mechanical",
          "Operational", "Track", and "Retraining of Personnel"; 10 departments
          — railways, rolling stock, applied mechanics, drawing methods,
          strength of materials, mathematics, social sciences, political
          economy, German, physics, and chemistry; the Academic Council and the
          library.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until 1933, the institute's divisions were called departments, and the
          head of the institute was referred to as the director. In 1933, the
          departments were transformed into faculties, and the director was
          renamed the head.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1934, the first graduation of 124 railway engineers in three
          specialties took place.

          The construction of the SASIIT educational building, a 32-apartment
          residential building for teachers, two one-story temporary
          dormitories, and other facilities began in 1932 and was completed in
          1936.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the commissioning of the institute's new building, the
          office-laboratory base, educational workshops, and housing fund were
          expanded. The transfer of classes to the new building was carried out
          as soon as the classroom base was ready. The first section of the
          institute's building was reconstructed in 1933.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting from September 1, 1933, only 5 daytime study groups and 4
          evening study groups were engaged in the new educational building. The
          first 4-story educational and laboratory building housed workshops and
          a canteen. The construction of the educational and laboratory building
          was completed in 1936.
        </p>
        <p>
          The library's book collection was not large, amounting to 4,812 copies
          in 1931 and 12,225 copies by 1938. The demand for books, journals, and
          specialized literature exceeded their availability, necessitating
          regular preparation of study guides and references for course and
          diploma projects by the institute's faculty.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 1933 to 1935, the institute's organizational structure underwent
          partial changes. In February 1933, the mechanical faculty was
          converted to a locomotive faculty, and in September 1934, the
          locomotive faculty was established. In November 1933, a special target
          faculty (FON) was created for the retraining of leadership personnel
          from the Central Asian and Turkestan-Siberian Railways. Within a short
          period, 80 management personnel were retrained.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1937, SAZIIT was renamed the Tashkent Institute of Railway
          Engineers (TashIIT). During its first 10 years of operation, the
          institute trained and graduated 156 technicians and 891 engineers,
          including 249 locomotive workers, 229 track workers, 118 railwaymen,
          138 railway builders, and 157 technical workers. During World War II,
          the institute had a strict state plan for admitting three faculties
          annually with 225-250 people.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1941, 227 students were admitted to the first-year courses of the
          steam locomotive, road construction, and operations faculties.
        </p>
        <p>
          The war disrupted the institute's peaceful routine. From the early
          days of the war, many teachers volunteered to go to the front,
          including: N.P. Alexandrov, N.G. Kochiev, B.A. Larionov, B.V. Volkov,
          M.F. Prasolov, D.V. Pistsov, S.V. Subbotin, and other staff members.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the extremely difficult autumn of the first year of the war, the
          institute's staff demonstrated traditional Uzbek hospitality, largely
          denying themselves comforts.

        <p>
          Evacuated teachers and students from other transport universities were
          accepted and placed as birodars. Thus, in September 1941 a large group
          of students of the Leningrad Institute of railway engineers was
          accepted. In November-December 1941, teachers, students, and
          administrative and technical staff of the Kharkiv Railway Engineers
          Institute (KIIT) came and settled. All this gave rise to the need for
          organizational and technical official transfers of a number of
          administrative character, changing the composition of the institutions
          and the council. Training sessions were organized in two shifts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two-story beds were installed to accommodate students in dormitories.
          In a short time, a single-storey hostel was built on the territory of
          the Institute.
        </p>

        <p>
          The structure of the teachers is located in the residential building
          of the Institute, partly in specially allocated dormitory rooms and in
          private apartments and in the city.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the years of the war, the institute had a strict plan of
          admission to three faculties every year. However, secondary schools
          and technical schools did not provide the necessary admission plans
          for Tashkent universities. Therefore, in 1942, the institute organized
          short-term self-sufficiency courses for the training of applicants.
          The courses were attended by individuals preparing 8-10 classes of
          Secondary School and, accordingly, from one to six months of classes
          were conducted. Soon these courses were transformed into a full-time
          preparatory department with three, six, and eight months of study.
          Like the students of the institute, the students of the preparatory
          department also enjoyed all the benefits of blacksmiths.
        </p>

        <p>
          Head of the Department “languages” MU F.fL.It was Markanova. Kafedra
          consists of about 8 academic groups, about 200 students studied. The
          courses were attended by teachers of general education of the
          Institute and secondary schools of the city.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the support of the Tashkent and Turkistan-Sibir Railways, a
          network of branches of the preparatory department was established on
          the basis of the tenth-grade graduates at the Russian, Uzbek, and
          Kazakh railway schools in Andijan, Kokand, Alma-Ata, Bishkek, and
          Djambul.
        </p>

        <p>
          For five years (from 1942 to 1947 year) more than 3 thousand
          applicants were prepared in the preparatory department.
        </p>

        <p>
          The war required a radical restructuring of the entire educational
          process. Since 1941, a shortened 3-year period for the training of
          Engineers has been introduced. A lot of work has been done on the
          revision of curriculum and curriculum of the subjects taught.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the transition to a shorter training period led to a
          deterioration in the quality of training. Therefore, since the new
          1942/43 academic year, the only term of student education for all
          transport institutions of the country was established – 4 years 10
          months. Graduates are awarded the following qualifications: railway
          engineer – mechanical, railway engineer – builder, communications
          engineer for transport and Freight works.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the war, the improvement of the organizational structure of the
          institute continued. A number of new departments and laboratories are
          being created that meet the requirements of time. Metal technologies,
          thermal engineering, organization of the movement of trains, stations
          and nodes, Organization of cargo work of civil constructions, geology,
          transport economy, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          The book fund of the library of the institute was replenished from the
          account of the KIIT Library Fund and amounted to about 140 thousand
          Tom. Nevertheless, the lack of educational and scientific literature
          was sharply felt. In the 1943/44 academic year, a fundamental library
          was created in a specially equipped room, a catalog of books was
          organized. In order to better serve the students, the Reading Room of
          the library began to work until 23 O’clock in the evening.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the Second World War, the results of research and production
          promotion were released at the scientific and Technical Conference of
          the Institute in 1944. More than 100 road workers took part in the
          conference. During the Second World War, the Institute graduated 508
          engineers. Since 1944, the heads of faculties were called Deans.
